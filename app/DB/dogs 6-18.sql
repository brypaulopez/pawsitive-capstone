(10, 'Affenpinscher', 'The Affen\'s apish look has been described many ways. They\'ve been called \'monkey dogs\' and \'ape terriers.\' The French say diablotin moustachu (\'mustached little devil\'), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks.     Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. \'This isn\'t a breed you train, \'a professional dog handler tells us, \'He\'s like a human. You befriend him.\' The dense, harsh coat is described as \'neat but shaggy\' and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs.', 'Affenpinschers are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as luxating patella, heart anomalies, vision problems, and hip dysplasia. Like other shorter-faced breeds, Affens can experience breathing problems during hot weather if they are permitted to overheat and then have difficulty panting in order to lower their body temperature, as dogs don\'t sweat to keep cool.', 'The Affenpinscher\'s medium-length, wiry coat should be groomed twice a week, first with a brush and then with a metal comb. Any mats should be pulled apart with the fingers. The hair on the head is usually brushed forward over the face, and then an inverted V-shape is cut to expose the eyes. Similarly, the hair on the bridge of the nose is trimmed into a fan shape to keep the eyes clear. The Affen\'s coat does not grow quickly, so a trimming a pet Affen every few months should suffice. The breed\'s national parent club, the Affenpinscher Club of America, provides a detailed grooming guide. Affens should also have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.', 'One of the attractions of the toy breeds is that their small size makes them ideal apartment dogs. While Affenpinschers can be perfectly happy living in close quarters, the breed is classified as \'moderately active,\' and as such, they do need exercise. Indoor play, both with his owner and just between himself and a toy, can be enough to make up a large chunk of an Affen\'s exercise regimen. Even so, a brisk walk once or twice a day is required. In addition to providing exercise, these walks give the Affen a chance to socialize both with people and other dogs.', 'Affenpinschers are courageous, bold, and often feisty. Basic obedience training is recommended. The breed has an undeserved reputation as being difficult to train because Affenpinschers are independent minded and can be stubborn. The key is that they are very intelligent and generally eager to please the humans they have bonded with. Keep in mind that they are easily bored and tend to lose interest during long training sessions. Shorter, more frequent sessions with a trainer who has experience working with toy breeds are usually quite successful.', 'The Affenpinscher should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian\'s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog\'s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog\'s calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\'s weight or diet.

(11, 'Afghan Hound', 'A description of the ideal dog of each recognized breed, to serve as an ideal against which dogs are judged at shows, originally laid down by a parent breed club and accepted officially by national or international bodies.', 'The Afghan Hound should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian\'s supervision and approval. Any diet should be appropriate to the dog\'s age (puppy, adult, or senior). As sight hounds, Afghan Hounds have naturally svelte physiques, and their protruding hipbones are a unique breed characteristic, not a sign of being underweight. That said, Afghan Hounds are athletic, active dogs, so be mindful that your dog is getting enough good nutrition to meet his needs. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog\'s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.', 'Afghan puppies have short, fuzzy coats (including adorable facial hair called \'monkey whiskers\') that require little maintenance. They don\'t stay that way for long, however. As is to be expected, the long, silky coat of an adolescent or adult Afghan requires regular grooming. Several hours per week of brushing are needed to keep the hair free of tangles and mats, as well as to remove any debris. Keeping the hair clean and mat-free is the key to keeping the Afghan\'s glorious coat looking its best. Regular bathing, with shampoo and conditioner, is also required. Like all breeds, Afghans should have their nails trimmed and their teeth brushed regularly.', 'Because Afghans are sighthounds, bred to hunt and chase prey by sight, they will have a strong instinct to run off in pursuit of perceived prey; walking off leash is not advisable. Short walks do not provide enough exercise for this athletic breed, and some owners take their leashed Afghans on long runs once they reach maturity. Ideally, an Afghan should have the opportunity to run full out several times a week in a large, enclosed area. Afghans are tall, lean, and strong, which makes them excellent jumpers, so their exercise area must have a high, secure fence.', 'Afghans are independent, dignified, and aloof in general, but they are affectionate and extremely loyal to humans they have bonded with. This loyalty can make it difficult for an adult Afghan to adjust to a new home. On the other hand, it can make them fairly easy to housetrain, because they want to please their owners. Unless obedience or agility competition is a goal, teaching basic commands such as come, sit, and stay is generally sufficient. Afghan Hound owners are often quick to point out that no amount of training will overcome the breed\'s hunting instinct to break off on a high-speed chase.', 'The Afghan Hound should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian\'s supervision and approval.

(12, 'Airedale Terrier', 'The Airedale Terrier, often called the \"King of Terriers,\" is a breed of dog known for its distinctive appearance, intelligence, and versatility. Here are some key details about Airedale Terriers:', 'Airedales are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will test for health concerns such as hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joint. An Airedale\'s ears should be checked regularly to remove foreign matter and avoid a buildup of wax, and his teeth should be brushed regularly.', 'The Airedale has a short, wiry coat that needs relatively little maintenance. Weekly brushing keeps the coat looking good and has the additional advantage of removing dead hair that would otherwise be shed around the house. (Some people with dog allergies have found that they can share a living space with a well-brushed Airedale without suffering any symptoms.) If the weekly session turns up any mats, they should be broken up with the fingers and then teased apart with a comb. Full grooming \' where the dog is bathed, brushed, and stripped or clipped \' should be done three or four times a year, either by the owner or a professional groomer.', 'Terriers are generally known for their high energy levels. Given that the Airedale is the largest of all terriers, that energy must be channeled into safe outlets. Fortunately, Airedales love to play with other family members. A daily play session of moderate length, in addition to walks (or backyard time) several times a day, should be enough to satisfy the Airedale\'s exercise requirements. Airedales play well with children, but interactions with toddlers and smaller children should be closely supervised. Airedales are rangy but strong; that strength, combined with a boisterous personality, can lead to mishaps.', 'Because of the Airedale\'s size (he is a medium-sized dog, but the largest of the terrier breeds), strength, and rambunctiousness, obedience training is highly recommended. At a minimum, an Airedale should learn basic obedience commands such as come, sit, and stay. The breed\'s intelligence and the fact that they bond closely with family members can make training easy. Owners and trainers should keep in mind that an intelligent dog is an easily bored dog, so varied training sessions will be more successful than repetitive ones. Also, an easily bored dog who is often left alone for long periods of time will tend to develop undesirable behaviors. It often helps to provide the dog with challenging toys that will keep him happily occupied.', 'The Airedale Terrier should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian\'s supervision and approval.

(13, 'Akita', 'Akitas are Japan\'s entry in the ancient canine clan of spitz-type dogs bred around the world on the globe\'s northern latitudes. The breed as we know it was developed in the early 17th century in the Akita prefecture of northern Japan. It is said that the emperor banished a wayward nobleman to the prefecture, the northernmost province of the island of Honshu, where the nobleman was ordered to live out his days as a provincial ruler. As it happens, this exiled aristocrat was an ardent dog man and encouraged the barons under his sway to compete in the breeding of a large, versatile hunting dog. Generations of selective breeding produced the Akita, a powerful hunter with a strong work ethic and stout heart who worked in packs on such big game as wild boar, deer, and the fearsome Yezo bear. Owning Akitas was once restricted to the imperial family and their court. In more recent times, just plain folks the world over have employed their Akitas as world-class family guardians.    Akitas have for centuries been the object of myth and legend and occupy a special place in Japanese culture. When a child is born, the parents will usually receive an Akita figurine signifying happiness and long life, in keeping with an old Japanese tradition. A famously loyal Akita of the 1920s named Hachiko is among Japan\'s most cherished symbols.    Various times during the Akita\'s long history, the breed teetered on the brink of extinction. To ensure the Akita\'s survival, a Japanese national breed club was founded in 1927. Helen Keller is credited with bringing the first Akita to the United States, a gift she received while visiting Japan. Akitas caught on in America after WWII, when returning GIs brought them back from the Pacific. The breed entered the AKC Stud Book in 1972.', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'N/A', 'N/A', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '1718643323.jpg', '2024-06-17 08:55:23', '2024-06-17 08:55:23'),
(14, 'Alaskan Klee Kai', 'The Alaskan Klee Kai is a small sized companion dog with a smooth, agile, and well-balanced gait, a body that is well proportioned with a level topline and a length slightly longer than height.  The wedge-shaped head, erect triangle shaped ears, well furred double coat in three symmetrical contrasting color varieties, and a loosely curled tail reflect its arctic heritage.', 'The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is a generally healthy breed. Responsible breeders screen breeding stock for health conditions including patellar luxation, autoimmune thyroiditis, heart murmur, eye disorders, and Factor VII deficiency. Prospective AKK owners are encouraged to purchase from responsible/reputable breeders who are doing these evaluations, and confirm the health screening of the sire and dam. Responsible breeders use the many tools available, along with the knowledge of their dogs\' pedigrees, to selectively choose breeding dogs in order to reduce the likelihood of temperament, structure and health concerns.', 'The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is a double coated breed, with a short dense undercoat and a longer outer coat of guard hairs. This coat not only helps insulate them from the cold and heat, it also helps protect the skin from the sun. While the undercoat is shed (or blown) twice a year, some owners quip that it lasts for six months at a time. Weekly brushings and/or combing help keep the coat and skin in good condition, and help reduce the hair around the house. AKK often need only a few baths a year as their coats tend to naturally repel dirt, and they do not have the dog odor that many breeds have. Blowing the dog with a strong cool blow-dryer is also a good way to remove loose hair and dirt. Avoid using any tools with blades. The nails should be trimmed regularly to prevent any foot problems. Alaskan Klee Kai competing in conformation require a bit more selective grooming or bathing for the best presentation. The breed standard is specific: \"The Alaskan Klee Kai is shown in its natural state and the only trimming permissible is around the foot area to present a clean/neat appearance. Any trimming of the whiskers, or the fur on any other part of the dog, is to be severely penalized.\"', 'The Alaskan Klee Kai (AKK) is an active dog with a medium-high energy level. Regular exercise and doing activities together, both physically and mentally, strengthens the bond between dog and owner, and helps to avoid potential destructive behavior. AKK enjoy doing performance sports or exploring life with their people in many activities such as camping, hiking, climbing, swimming, boating, kayaking, and even on paddle boards! For those who live in a more urban setting, or have a more sedate lifestyle, daily walks or a game of fetch can also provide great exercise. Alaskan Klee Kai are foremost loving companion dogs who form strong bonds with their family and are as happy playfully interacting with their owners exploring the outdoors as they are relaxing lovingly on the laps of their youthful or elderly owners. Like many dog breeds, Alaskan Klee Kai are curious, clever, fast and sneaky, and may have a high prey drive, so it is important to keep the dog on a leash or in a securely fenced area at all times when outside of the home. AKK are not suitable for people who cannot spend time with their dogs', 'The Alaskan Klee Kai are a perceptive breed that enjoys being physically and mentally challenged. They love learning new things, and have an energetic eagerness to participate in a broad array of activities which make them well suited for multiple performance sports such as Agility, Racing, Obedience, Rally, Scent Work, Weight Pull, Dock Diving, and Carting. They are also used in therapy work, service work, diabetic and gluten detection, as well as emotional support dogs. AKK have a sensitive, reserved and cautious nature. A gentle hand, positive reinforcement, proper early socialization and training throughout their lives is very beneficial.', 'The Alaskan Klee Kai should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarians supervision and approval. The diet should be appropriate to the dogs age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some dogs are prone to excessive weight gain, so watch your dogs calorie consumption and weight level.

Historically, they were bred to be a utility dog used for working the farm.', 'The American Bulldog is considered a healthy breed. Owners should maintain a schedule of examinations and vaccinations as recommended by their veterinarian. Hip and joint problems are a concern for this breed, hip and elbow evaluations should also be done. Just like other breeds, the American Bulldog has the potential to develop genetic health problems. Breeders should pre-screen any potential breeding pairs for genetic diseases.', 'Grooming your American Bulldog can be a pretty easy task. This breed does not need to be bathed often, only occasional baths when they become dirty. Regular brushing will help keep their coat clean and shiny. Their nails should be trimmed every few weeks and ears should be cleaned once a month or as needed. Their teeth should be brushed regularly. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.', 'The American Bulldog is an athlete. For puppies, owners will need to practice non-impact exercises to decrease possible bone and joint damage. As adults, the American Bulldog will need a range of activities from jogs, hikes, tug-a-war games, to training exercises. The breed does not do well being left alone in a back yard. As this may lead to a variety of behavior problems related to pent-up energy. This breed requires frequent exercise and constant stimulation. Developing his athletic abilities will help this breed stay fit and happy.', 'Early socialization and puppy training classes are vital in channeling the American Bulldog\'s energy. Rules and routines should be put in place early and adhered to as dogs grow up. They require a firm but loving hand to establish and retain proper boundaries. The more exposure to good training practices, other dogs, and people, the more likely the success at being managed both inside and outside of their environment.', 'American Bulldogs are healthy dogs and will do very well with a variety of quality dog foods. American Bulldog puppies should be fed a large-breed puppy food for the first 14 months of their life in order to ensure slow and steady growth.

The sight of the American English Coonhound tearing through the moonlit woods, all sinew and determination, bawling their lusty night music, is coon-hunter heaven. Standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder, American English Coonhounds are deep-chested, sweet-faced athletes beloved by sportsmen for their speed and endurance. Stretched tightly across the athletic frame is a medium-length coat of various patterns, some with ticking. The head is broad with a domed skull, with soft, low-hung ears and dark-brown eyes that glow with warmth and kindness. American English Coonhounds are mellow when off duty but tenacious and stubborn in pursuit of their ring-tailed prey. Their work drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for things other than coon hunting, and their loud, ringing bark can make the breed a bad fit as house pets for novice owners. Some passionate fans of American English Coonhounds feel that without a sporting outlet for this breed\'s houndy virtues, you\'re simply wasting a good dog.', 'Still bred primarily as a hard-working dog, which must have an efficient physical condition, the American English Coonhound is generally a healthy breed. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for health conditions such as hip and elbow dysplasia as well as eye disorders such as progressive retinal atrophy and cataracts.

He needs a lot of exercise to stay healthy and happy. The breed has a very strong prey drive, so should never be allowed off leash in an uncontrolled situation, as he will not be able to resist the instinct to follow an interesting scent he detects with his sensitive nose. He requires a fenced area where he can run freely. Chasing a ball in his backyard can be an excellent source of exercise.', 'Following through with proper early socialization of your American English Coonhound is paramount, or your puppy may become possessive over food or toys in your home. The key to a well-adjusted, mentally healthy dog is to have him experience positive interactions with many different kinds of people in a variety of places and situations. Like many hounds, English dogs have a split personality: tenacious, tireless, and stubborn on the trail, but at home these spirited hunters are sweetly amiable companions.

(17, 'American Eskimo Dog', 'The name American Eskimo Dog is a misnomer: The peoples referred to by the term \"Eskimos\" weren\'t involved in the founding of the breed.     The successive waves of German immigrants that reached American shores beginning in the early 1800s had a profound impact on the development of the American Midwest. German farmers who sought opportunity in America brought their Old World ways to such states as Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ohio\' and the German influence can still be felt in the upper Midwest to this day. Lutheranism, the brewing industry, and the region\'s mania for German-style foods are cultural touchstones these immigrants transplanted to their corner of the New World. Another was a Nordic breed called the German Spitz, used as all-around farm dogs. These little white dogs were ancestors of the modern Eskie. By the latter years of the 19th century, it was becoming difficult to keep these beautiful, highly trainable dogs down on the farm. Show business was beckoning. Back when traveling circuses, vaudeville troupes, and Wild West shows crisscrossed pre-electronic America, German Spitz,  thanks to their intelligence, agility, and showy looks became mainstays of trained-dog acts. (This held true well into the 20th century. Perhaps America\'s most famous performing dog of the 1930s was Pierre, an Eskie tightrope walker with the Barnum & Bailey Circus.) Upon America\'s entry into World War I in 1917, the country was gripped by a prejudice against all things Teutonic. The breed\'s German name was changed to \'American Eskimo\' Dog, after the name used by a Spitz breeding kennel in Ohio. Though the breed has a long and fascinating U.S. history, it was not until 1995 that the AKC registered its first American Eskimo Dog. The little white wonder dogs who performed various chores around Midwestern farms, and later charmed audiences under the circus big top, are today sought out by pet owners looking for versatile, fun-loving companions.', 'NA', 'NA', 'NA', 'NA', 'NA', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Na', 'Na', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, '1718644411.jpg', '2024-06-17 09:13:31', '2024-06-17 09:13:31');
